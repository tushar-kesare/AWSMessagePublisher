# AWSMessagePublisher
This is WPF application to quickly publish messages to AWS SNS.

![AWS Message Publisher](./AWSMessagePublisher.JPG?raw=true "AWS Message Publisher")

Default AWS Credentials, topic and message type can be configured in app.config so that they do not need to be entered manually.

Check "Use Default Credentials" checkbox to use credetails from default aws credentials file.

If you think of any improvements/suggestions, let me know.
